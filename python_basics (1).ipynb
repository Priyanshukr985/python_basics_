Python is a high-level programming language that follows a compiled-interpreted model: Python code is first compiled into bytecode, which is then executed by the Python Virtual Machine (PVM).\n","\n","Python is popular because it is beginner-friendly with a clean and readable syntax, has extensive library and framework support, and is highly versatile. With the growth of AI, data science, and machine learning, Python has become a key language in many modern technology domains."],"metadata":{"id":"MwtJkr3D_O4h"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Q2. What is an interpreter in Python\n","\n","Ans2.

What is type casting in Python\n","\n","Ans9. Type casting in Python refers to converting one data type into another.\n","For example, the input() function always returns data as a string, but using int() can convert it into an integer\n","\n","Q10. What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting\n","\n"," Ans10. Python interpretor automatically converts the data type implicitly but in explicit conversion one need to convert it manually For example, the input() function always returns data as a string, but we may use int() and can convert it into an integer\n","\n"," Q11. What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python\n","\n"," Ans11. it allows decision making by executing certain block of codes written inside it for eg. if , else , elif\n","\n"," Q12. How does the elif statement work\n","\n"," Ans12. elif= else if it checks the next condition written inside it only if previous one doesn't hold true .\n","\n"," Q13.

Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop.\n","\n","Ans14.
